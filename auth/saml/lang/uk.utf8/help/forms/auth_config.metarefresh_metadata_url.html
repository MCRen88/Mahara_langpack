<h3>Metadata refresh URL</h3>
<p>If a valid URL is provided in this field, the SAML plugin will automatically download the latest metadata and store it locally. This removes the need to update the metadata manually when it changes on your Identity Provider. You will need to have cron running in order for the metadata to be checked.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The data fetched from this URL will take precedence over the XML metadata (if any were entered) and replace it.</p>
