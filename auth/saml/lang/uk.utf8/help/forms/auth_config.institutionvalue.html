<h3>Institution check value</h3>
<p>This is the value that will be checked against the "Institution attribute"
value as passed from the Identity Provider (IdP) that shows which institution
the user belongs to. If "Do partial string match with institution shortname" is
set to "Yes", then this value can be a regular expression that will be used to
check against the "Institution attribute" value.</p>
