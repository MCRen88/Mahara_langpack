<h3>SAML metadata for the Identity Provider (IdP) to connect to</h3>
<p>This element requires the XML formatted metadata for the IdP that you want
  to connect to.</p>
<p>If you add a new IdP, please select "Add new Identity Provider" from
  "Available Identity Providers" and add in the relevant metadata to the
  "Institution Identity Provider SAML metadata" field.</p>
<p>Otherwise, select an existing IdP from "Available Identity Providers". If
  you make any changes to the metadata, it will be updated for the other
  institutions using that metadata as well. Therefore, be careful what you
  change.</p>
